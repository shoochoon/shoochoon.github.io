# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Shuchun

I am specialised in Russian linguistics, Chinese modern political philosophy and interested in more things.

Thesis title: Tracing Logical Fallacies through Rhetorical Structure: A Case Study of  Tolstoyâ€™s What Is Art?
This study introduces a novel framework that integrates rule-based semantic similarity metrics, rhetorical structure annotation, and zero-shot large language model (LLM) prompting to investigate the complex interaction among rhetorical strategies, textual form, and logical soundness in Tolstoyâ€™s What Is Art?. Our preliminary findings indicate that specific structural patterns, such as high semantic similarity scores and chains of elaborations, reliably signal areas of potential fallacious reasoning. Our preliminary findings indicate that specific structural patterns, such as high semantic similarity scores and chains of elaborations, reliably signal areas of potential fallacious reasoning. Employing simulated reader stances, the research reveals significant divergences in LLM behavior, particularly a sharp contrast between Claude and Gemini when prompted for a neutral reader stance. While Claude identified four fallacies under this condition, Gemini detected none, suggesting model-specific interpretations of ``neutrality'' and varying manifestations of an inherent ``logicality bias''.

Thesis title: The Tianxia Concept and Morality in Modern Chinese Philosophy
This dissertation explores the complex relationship between politics and morality through the lens of the ancient Chinese concept of Tianxia in its modern reinterpretations. It focuses on the argumentative models employed by contemporary Tianxia theorists and examines how their frameworks contribute to the politicisation of Tianxia in present-day discourse.

- 10/2018-12/2024 Moscow State University, PhD in Russian Linguistics
Thesis title: Nominalisation of Adjectives in Modern Russian Language
This dissertation analyzes deadjectival nominalisation in modern Russian, with particular attention to linguistic mechanisms such as metonymy, polysemy, and syntactic derivation. The goal of the study is to propose a theoretical framework for the automated detection of nominalisations, with potential applications in computational text analysis.

As part of this research, I developed a dictionary-based database classifying all deadjectival nouns listed in Shvedovaâ€™s Dictionary of Russian (2011) into three categories: pure syntactic derivatives, pure lexical derivatives, and polysemic derivatives. The study also investigates the ongoing process of nominalisation using the suffix -ism, exploring its relevance to synonym detection through diagnostic contextual analysis.
