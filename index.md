# 👋 Hello, I'm Shuchun

My work focuses on computational linguistics, Russian grammar, and modern Chinese political philosophy. But my curiosity extends far beyond these fields.

## 🎓 Academic Experience

### **MAS in Natural Language Processing**
**Ghent University** · *Belgium*

*September 2023 – September 2025*

Thesis title: **Tracing Logical Fallacies through Rhetorical Structure: A Case Study of  Tolstoy’s *What Is Art*?**

This study introduces a novel framework that integrates rule-based semantic similarity metrics, rhetorical structure annotation, and zero-shot large language model (LLM) prompting to investigate the complex interaction among rhetorical strategies, textual form, and logical soundness in Tolstoy’s What Is Art?. Our preliminary findings indicate that specific structural patterns, such as high semantic similarity scores and chains of elaborations, reliably signal areas of potential fallacious reasoning. Employing simulated reader stances, the research reveals significant divergences in LLM behavior, particularly a sharp contrast between Claude and Gemini when prompted for a neutral reader stance. While Claude identified four fallacies under this condition, Gemini detected none, suggesting model-specific interpretations of 'neutrality' and varying manifestations of an inherent 'logicality bias'.

### **PhD in Philosophy**  

**RUDN University** · *Moscow, Russia*  

*Research Period*:  September 2021 – June 2024
*Degree Awarded*: February 2025

Thesis title: **The *Tianxia* Concept and Morality in Modern Chinese Philosophy**

This dissertation explores the complex relationship between politics and morality through the lens of the ancient Chinese concept of *Tianxia* in its modern reinterpretations. It focuses on the argumentative models employed by contemporary *Tianxia* theorists and examines how their frameworks contribute to the politicisation of *Tianxia* in present-day discourse.

### **PhD in Linguistics**  

**Moscow State University** · *Moscow, Russia*

*Research Period*:  October 2018 – September 2021
*Degree Awarded*: December 2024

Thesis title: **Nominalisation of Adjectives in Modern Russian Language**

This dissertation analyzes deadjectival nominalisation in modern Russian, with particular attention to linguistic mechanisms such as metonymy, polysemy, and syntactic derivation. The goal of the study is to propose a theoretical framework for the automated detection of nominalisations, with potential applications in computational text analysis.

As part of this research, I developed a dictionary-based database classifying all deadjectival nouns listed in Shvedova’s Dictionary of Russian (2011) into three categories: pure syntactic derivatives, pure lexical derivatives, and polysemic derivatives. The study also investigates the ongoing process of nominalisation using the suffix -ism, exploring its relevance to synonym detection through diagnostic contextual analysis.
